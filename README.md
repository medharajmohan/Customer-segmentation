• Since the store is based in UK, the number of customers are high in UK compared to other countries.
• Although the number of customers outside of UK are less, the average order value of customers outside UK is high.


Clustering of customers into different groups is done performing the Recency, Frequency and Monetary (RFM) analysis of each customer.

• Customers in cluster 3, though less in number, are the most frequent customers whose purchases are also high in value.
• Customers in cluster 2 are not the best set of customers from business point of view. These customers are less frequent in purchases and the value of purchase is also low.
• While providing excellent customer service to customers in cluster 3 is imperative, additional services can be provided to customers belonging to cluster 1 to improve the profitability of the business.
